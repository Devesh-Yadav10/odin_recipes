So, um I have came a long way into html and this is all because of this laptop and also huge thanks to TOP, without these I wouldn't have been here. Although I'm not practicing this much and like trying that much but still I've made progress. I am not going to stop until I build my own website which should look good, be more interactive, and cozy too.
Also this is my first project, regarding some recipes website.
Hope I do the best!
Peace out!
